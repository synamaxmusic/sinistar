;                               <<< DEBUG DEFINES >>>

PROMS   EQU     1               ;* Define before burning proms

;;  PROMS is on by DEFAULT!
;;
;;  Taken from WITT/RICHFIXE.ASM
;;
;;  During development, a routine in EXECJNK called "VRLOAD" was used for
;;  overload handling. If the program is unable to finish processing everything
;;  in the executive loop before drawing the next frame on the CRT screen, then
;;  the game would get overloaded and slow down would occur.
;;
;;  To immediately signal when a overload occurs, VRLOAD causes the screen to
;;  flash white for a frame.  This is most noticable whenever the game starts
;;  up or transitions to a status screen.  In the final game, NOPs are used to
;;  patch over the instructions that flash the screen white.
;;
;;  If PROMS is not defined, then the screen flashing returns.
;;
;;  It also DISABLES KENCHK so that copyright protection doesn't trigger during
;;  debugging.
;;
;;  Note: This doesn't take affect until AOE.ASM is included, so use
;;  DisableKenChk if the magic byte at address $A1B3 is still showing up as
;;  non-zero during attract mode/gameplay.
;;
;;  Moving this from RICHFIXE.ASM was kinda unnecessary as this define is
;;  usually left on all the time, but I figured it would be easier to
;;  enable/disable it here rather than having it separate from the other debug
;;  options.

;DisableKenChk EQU 1

;;  The problem with PROMS is that it is defined in RICHFIXE.ASM, which is
;;  referenced in AOE.ASM.  If AOE is not included in the build, then KenChk
;;  will still trigger.
;;
;;  Enable this to force the copyright protection to stay off no matter what.
;;
;;  This can be useful for when the diagnostic rom is not included in the build

;FakeChecksums EQU 1

;;  Taken from SAM/T13.ASM
;;
;;  If you are including the diagnostic ROM 11 in the build, then use this for
;;  debugging.  This is really important if you want to mess around with the
;;  code or work on mods.  Also useful for enabling several different mods
;;  at once.
;;
;;  During power up, the ROM test uses a checksum table at $F34F to verify file
;;  integrity.  To make debugging with mods much easier, enable this to zero
;;  out the checksum table and cheat the ROM test so that you can gain access
;;  to the "Game Adjustment" menu.
;;
;;  Zeroing out the checksums also should prevent the copyright protection from
;;  triggering.  Look at address $A1B3 to ensure the byte is zero, otherwise
;;  the game will start acting weird.
;;

;NOTEST EQU     1

;;  Uncommenting this EQU can be useful for debugging and greatly decreases
;;  wait times by skipping the power up ROM/RAM Rug Test.  It does not disable
;;  the ROM/RAM "Rug" test itself, as it is still accessible by pressing the
;;  service (aka "advance") button.

;SAMDEBUG EQU   1

;;  Recommended for invincible cheat
;;
;;  This debug define found in Sam's module allows the player to respawn
;;  forever, even if they run out of extra ships.  This only changes two bytes
;;  in the code and doesn't mess up any symbol addresses.  This was originally
;;  labeled as "DEBUG" but I renamed it to differentiate from the next two
;;  defines which were also called "DEBUG".

;InfiniteShips EQU 1

;;  Enable this to never run out of lives.  This is from Rich's module and
;;  while it takes up more space, it increases the player's number of ships
;;  upon every Turn initialization so the player never runs out.

;NoDeath        EQU     1

;;  This disables player deaths.  Warrior shots don't hurt anymore (yay!), but
;;  if the player gets caught by the Sinistar, they'll get soft-locked (boo!).
;;  This was taken from Rich's module as well.

;DisableSinistarCollision EQU   1

;;  This new hack makes the player pass through the Sinistar and prevent
;;  getting soft-locked while NoDeath is enabled.

;Witt   EQU     1

;;  Uncomment "Witt" to force the Sinistar to spawn instantly and prevent the
;;  warriors from shooting at the player.

;WittRock EQU   1

;;  This new define enables a previously-unknown sprite edit of the tiny
;;  Planetoid image that was used to denote Rich's developmental build
;;  from the final ROM.

;WittBombs EQU   1

;;  Forget "add-a-ball", the newest innovation is "add-a-bomb"!
;;
;;  Found in Rich's commented out debug code in WITT/AOE.ASM, this cheat allows
;;  the player to add bombs using the player 2 button!  Also restores debug text
;;  that Rich used during development.  The default Sinibomb message is replaced
;;  with "DEVELOPMENT BOMBS ADDED".  When no more bombs can be added, the
;;  message area displays a funny Star Trek reference: "CAPTAIN OUR BOMB BAY IS FULL".
;;

;WittBuild EQU   1

;;  MUST BE ENABLED WITH WittBombs
;;
;;  This additional cheat forces the game to add a Sinistar piece after filling up
;;  the bomb-bay with the P2 button.  This define is nested instead of the code for
;;  WittBombs, so it must be enabled for WittBuild to work.  It also overrides the
;;  Star Trek message and replaces it with "DEVELOPMENT PIECE ADDED".

;;  Several of the following mods have been combined together (see MOD COMBOS

;;  uncommenting one line instead of up to 5 lines.  Only one mod combo should
;;  be defined at a time.

;                               <<< MOD COMBOS >>>

;;  To enable, simply remove the first semi-colon in front of the mod combo you
;;  want to use.  Only one mod combo should be defined:

;V19145 EQU     1       ;; Pause Mod / MarqueeFix
;V19245 EQU     1       ;; Pause Mod / MarqueeFix / DifficultyMod
;V19345 EQU     1       ;; MarqueeFix / DifficultyMod

;V19645 EQU     1       ;; MarqueeFix / SAMTAIL / ExtraShipFix (Closest to "Perfect" ROMs)

;                         <<< IMPORTANT MOD NOTES >>>

;;
;;  To make it easier to identify which ROM set we're running, we'll borrow a
;;  trick from Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar in the Robotron Tie-Die ROMs and
;;  use the high score to denote a "version" number.
;;
;;  Normally, the first high score entry in the "Survivors Today" table is
;;  always set to 19045.
;;
;;  We'll change the zero here to ID the mod combo:
;;
;;    19145 = Pause Mod / MarqueeFix
;;    19245 = Pause Mod / MarqueeFix / DifficultyMod
;;    19345 = MarqueeFix / DifficultyMod
;;    19445 = Pause Mod / MarqueeFix / DifficultyMod / SAMTAIL
;;    19545 = MarqueeFix / DifficultyMod / SAMTAIL
;;    19645 = MarqueeFix / SAMTAIL / ExtraShipFix (Closest to "Perfect" ROMs) [Factory reset required]
;;
;;  19645 requires a factory reset in order to copy the new default
;;  Extra Ship value to NVRAM.
;;
;;  Note: only enabling MarqueeFix doesn't change the high score entries.
;;
;;  19345 and 19545 are great for arcade operators who want to install these
;;  mods but prefer not to have players pause the game.
;;
;;  ExtraShipFix is not enabled for the other ROMs because of the factory reset
;;  and it's kinda wasteful to do a ROM swap for a one-byte edit.  To do the 
;;  same effect with the other mod combos, simply change the "Additional Extra
;;  Ship Point Factor" to it's original value of 5,000 and then save.  This mod
;;  is only included in V19645 to create a "perfect" ROM set that automatically
;;  sets the new default value.
;;
;;  Disclaimer: PauseMod has the potential to cause screen burn-in if the
;;  "PAUSED" text is displayed for an extended period of time.  I, SynaMax,
;;  assume no responsibility or liability if the PauseMod causes burn-in damage
;;  to your monitor.
;;
;;  Lastly, some really creative hacking was needed in order to fit SAMTAIL
;;  alongside these other mods.  If SAMTAIL and MarqueeFix are combined
;;  together, then the sound test in the diagnostics ($FE6C) is overwritten and
;;  skipped.  If SAMTAIL and PauseMod are combined, then the routine that sends
;;  a signal to the ROM board LED is overwritten ($F211).

;                               <<< HOW MODS WORK >>>

;;
;;  Use "DisableTests" below to make mods possible in Sinistar.
;;
;;  Originally, I had the RAM and ROM tests in ROM 11 ($F09F - $F370)
;;  overwritten to fit "MarqueeFix" and "PauseMod" but this doesn't work on
;;  real hardware, as we were running into issues with the watchdog chip.
;;
;;  Any new mods are now relocated so that they overwrite the CRT Test Pattern,
;;  Color Bars and Switch tests in the diganostics ROM ($F4FB - $F928).  To
;;  make this space available for adding mods, uncomment the "DisableTests"
;;  define.
;;
;;  Again, these mods can be combined with others, however if you are running
;;  into "ROM ERROR" messages on power up, then enable "FakeChecksums" to fix
;;  this.
;;


;                               <<< MOD DEFINES >>>

;DisableTests EQU 1

;;  To make mods possible for Sinistar, we use the space between addresses
;;  $F4FB - $F928 in diagnostic ROM 11. This is where the cross hatch test,
;;  color bar tests and switch tests are located. Enable this define to make
;;  the diagnostics skip these routines and give us $42C bytes of space to
;;  overwrite.
;;
;;  This is already enabled for both MarqueeFix and PauseMod.
;;
;;                                              Changes ROMs: 11

;MarqueeFix EQU 1

;;  This restores the awesome original "Marquee" title screen found in the
;;  prototype AMOA '82 build.  Due to space constraints, this was not included
;;  in the final build.
;;
;;  To get this to work, I had to overwrite the cross hatch, color bar and
;;  switch tests in ROM 11 and then patched ROM 9 to make RJ's attract mode
;;  routines load the AMOA graphic.
;;
;;  "DisableTests" is already enabled for this mod.  New Checksums for the ROM
;;  test are also enabled.  Can be combined with "PauseMod" and/or
;;  "DifficultyMod" and/or "SAMTAIL" with valid checksums.
;;
;;                                              Changes ROMs: 9, 11

;DifficultyMod EQU 1

;;  This reduces the difficulty of the game by modifying the enemy population
;;  values starting at $7ABE.  You can watch my video for more detailed info on
;;  how this mod works and why I chose these new values:
;;  https://youtu.be/HnfcAudPPS4
;;
;;  Adds valid checksums for ROM 11.
;;
;;                                              Changes ROMs: 8, 11

;PauseMod EQU   1

;;  Press the Player 1 button during gameplay to pause!  Pressing it again
;;  resumes the game.  This mod was inspired by the Joust Pause Mod found on
;;  Coinoplove.com and uses very similar code to achieve the same effect.  The
;;  "PAUSED" text displayed on screen uses a routine inspired by Witt's code
;;  responsible for drawing the "EMPTY" text at the start of the game.
;;
;;  This mod can be enabled with MarqueeFix!  "DisableTests" is already enabled
;;  for this mod.  New Checksums for the ROM test are also enabled.
;;
;;                                              Changes ROMs: 4, 10, 11

;SAMTAIL        EQU     1

;;  Taken from SAM/TAIL.SRC, this mod restores a unused jet exhaust "tail" to
;;  the player ship!
;;
;;  This code was first discovered back in October 2023, but it wasn't until
;;  February 2024 that the unused source code was correctly implemented into
;;  the final game.  Initially, I thought the tail was supposed to be a blue
;;  color, but I now realized that is incorrect.  This mod produces an effect
;;  that much better resembles a rocket flame trail by using a combination of
;;  red and yellow pixels.  The tail also appears to react to how far the
;;  49-way joystick is being pushed.  Slightly pulling on the stick results in
;;  a diminished flame tail, while not pressing it at all turns the effect off.
;;
;;  This unused feature explains why Jack Haeger's marquee artwork depicts the
;;  player ship with a jet exhaust!
;;
;;                                              Changes ROMs: 4, 8, 9, 11
;;
;;  If you enable SAMTAIL by itself then you will need to turn on
;;  "FakeChecksums" and "DisableTests", or you will get checksum errors in the
;;  ROM test.

;ExtraShipFix EQU 1

;;  This restores the original "Additional Extra Ship Point Factor" to it's
;;  original value of 5,000 (per SAM/DEFAULT.SRC).  This makes it much easier
;;  to score extra lives!
;;
;;  You'll need to do a factory reset or clear/delete your NVRAM in order for
;;  the new default value to be copied over.
;;
;;  Because this is just a one-byte edit, this can be combined with other mods
;;  like MarqueeFix and/or DifficultyMod.
;;
;;  This mod is kinda not really needed, since you can just change the value in
;;  the "Game Adjustments" menu to 5000 and then save.
;;
;;  The only time this mod is being used is for V19645.
;;
;;  If enabled, then the checksums for V19645 mod will be used, but otherwise
;;  there are no valid checksums yet for this mod, so enable "FakeChecksums"
;;
;;                                              Changes ROMs: 5

;QuickOperatorEntry EQU 1

;;  This one-byte mod makes it much quicker to edit the title screen's operator
;;  message, which can be accessed from the Game Adjustments service menu.  The
;;  only caveat is that the operator message entry screen and high score entry
;;  screen use the same routines, so changing the value to make it go faster
;;  also affects the input for high score initials.
;;
;;  I'm assuming that RJ purposely patched this value to make editing slower
;;  because play-testers were messing up their high score initials with the
;;  shorter time.
;;
;;  No valid checksum yet for this mod, enable "FakeChecksums" to pass ROM test
;;
;;                                              Changes ROMs: 9

;BargraphEnable EQU 1           ;* Define this symbol to include Graphic Diagnostics

;BargraphAlt EQU 1

;;  In the previous list, two variables are not enabled, "GVelocity" and "GDistance".
;;  Instead, "GFLANG" and "GANANG" for the warrior squadron leader are shown in blue-gray
;;  and gray colors respectively.

;;  Uncomment this define to have the BARGRAPH routine display the Velocity and Distance
;;  parameters instead and disable the squadron leader color bars.
;;

;                       <<< DEPRECATED DEFINES BELOW!!! DON'T USE >>>

;EnableMods EQU 0

;;  Turn this on if you want to enable mods like the Marquee Fix or Difficulty Mod.
;;  Please leave PROMS defined!
;;
;;  This disables the Rug test, just like NOTEST, but this also zeros out the
;;  ROMTBL checksum table, so that we don't trigger the copyright protection.
;;  If the ROM/RAM tests have been untouched, hitting the service (aka "advance")
;;  button should still work.  With the "auto up" switch enabled, pressing the
;;  advance button will take you directly to the Bookkeeping and Game Adjustment
;;  screens.

;DiagnosticTestFix EQU 0

;;  Only works if EnableMods is defined.  Restores access to diagnostic tests for
;;  CMOS, Sound, Switches and Color bars by skipping the ROM/RAM tests.  This is
;;  automatically enabled for MarqueeFix.  This is needed for any mods that overwrite
;;  the RAM/ROM rug test area ($F09F-$F370) and/or before the CMOS test screen at $F404.
;;
;;  When this is enabled, the game will wipe away the screen and wait forever until the
;;  "advance" button (aka F2 in MAME) is pressed again.  Keep pressing the advance
;;  button to go through the remaining diagnostic screens.
